# QuantumProblem
A complicated Java Algorithm problem

The PDF contains Question B, which is the problem that this code answers. The goal of this assignment is to show you how I break
a much more complicated question up into smaller parts that can be understood by an outside user through the use of helper functions
and good commenting practice. 

Notes:
-When explaining the question in the PDF, image B is incorrect, as there should only be 2 vertical red lines instead of 3. This was
corrected in class but an updated PDF was never given. This is just to help remove confusion when reading the problem.

-Due to the nature of the question, and inputs over 8 take a large amount of time to compute. This is expected from the scope of the
assignment.
